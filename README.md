# Nulife : Introduction
Nulife AKA Newlife is your first life management app, where you can track your daily habits and goals and do your tasks more efficiently, It's a new portal to a more organized and fun life. It's life the game version of your self with stats and lifepoints
# The beginning of Nulife
Nulife was not always designed for this, at first Since I needed a to do list I thought maybe I can make my own, yes another mobile app that nobody asked for, here are my initial thoughts :

## A to do list of course 
I am thinking of a crossed out task animation, I don't know how to execute it though 
## maybe a timer 
maybe I can add a timer and notification for important tasks as well
## planning day events (Puzzled up or lego'ed up)
puzzle or Lego structure for a more organized and flexible scheduling
## What did you learn today ?, Productivity & Feeling meter
I am thinking about adding achievements of the day and how productive the day was as well as rating of feelings or something like that, so we can make live statistics.
